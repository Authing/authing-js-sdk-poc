## TODO

- The code of `@shared/IdentityProvider` and `@shared/utils` are temporary, and conditional compilation are required

- Manual shake jsencrypt.js

- Manual shake sm-crypto

- Support Miniapp cross-platform

- Both `function` and `class` are OK, but the `function` is better and they must be packaged by platform

- Use `peerDependencies`
